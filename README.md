# CHESSELLA

A personal project that I finished in 2006-2007 and then I quickly forgot about. I was disappointed that people just were not interested, but maybe I gave up too soon.

However, the software has been running stably for 10 years under http://www.chessella.com. 

Now, in 2017, I have decided to publish the code, but I didn't seem to have the latest version of the source - 

However, decompilation is a life saver, the full web application is available again, and fixes, improvements and upgrade are planned.
