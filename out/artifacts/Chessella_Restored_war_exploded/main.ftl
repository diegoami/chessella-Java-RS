<h1>About Chessella</h1>

<P>This is a web site where you can upload and share your (preferably <B>annotated</B>) chess games. The main reason I created this site,
though, is to train my chess skills. <B>Chess diagrams</B> are printed in the games just <U>before
any critical move</U>, so that you can <U>stop</U> at a diagram and try and <U>guess</U> the move.</P>
<P>
<B>Important : The games you post must be either commented by yourself, 
	or they cannot be copyrighted by third parties! 
   If you insist on posting copyrighted games, make sure they are private !</B>
</P>

<h1>Search for games</h1>
<P> You can search for games other users have uploaded. Just go to 
	<A HREF="games/searchgamesform.action">Search games</A> and enter some search criteria.
You can then <I>export</I> the games you found to 
the <B>PGN</B> format.
<P> I am mainly interested in <B>annotated</B> games. 
Emphasis here is on <U>training</U>, not search in a database.</P>	
</P>

 <h1>Show a game</h1>
<P>When <I>browsing</I> games, you can choose to <U>watch a game</U>. The simple game viewer
allows you to go back and forth in the game, or to jump to a move. You have to click on the
board to go back to the original position</P>
<P>A <B>link</B> to the game can be seen at the bottom of the game viewer, so that you can link
to the game from your web site</P>
<P>What makes this site different, though, is the <B>option to print diagrams</B>. When viewing
a game, you are expected to <U>stop</U> at a diagram and try and <U>guess</U> the move. That
is why I made this site anyway. This is very useful when trying to learn opening variants or practise
tactics<P>
<P> You may need to <U>resize</U> your browser window for best results. There is also on option, if registered,
to make the boards <U>bigger</U></P>	

<h1>Register </h1>
<P>To upload games, you first have to register. Registration is hassle-free.
Make sure you enter an email address in the <I>Settings</I> manager, so that I can help you recover your password
if you happened to lose it.
Creating more than one account is allowed, if you want to categorize your games</P>

<h1>Upload games </h1>
<P>Your games must me in the <B>Portable Game Notation</B> (PGN) format. You can 
<I>Add games</I> and <U>paste</U> them in the text field. As of now, there is a limit of 10 games
	you can add to the database at a time.  If the games are on the net, you can <U>Get Games from URL</U>
 <h1>My games</h1>
 <P>You can see a list of the games you have uploaded here.
	 Click on a row to jump to a game.
	 Scroll right and you can delete <IMG SRC="games/delete.gif"></IMG> a game. Games which 
 are marked for deletion <IMG SRC="games/deleted.gif"></IMG> will be deleted after clicking on
 <I>Remove deleted games</I></P>
<P>You can also set a game to public <IMG SRC="games/public_co.gif"></IMG> or private 
<IMG SRC="games/private_co.gif"></IMG>
</P>
  
 

  <h1>Settings</h1> 
  
  <P>Before what moves are chess diagrams printed ? You can set it here.
  Chess diagrams can be printed
  <UL>
  <LI>Before a <U>critical</U> move (!, ?, !!, ?? , !? , ?! )
  <LI>Before a <U>commented</U> move
  <LI>Before a move which has several <U>branches</U>
 </UL>
 
<P>
 At this stage you cannot set this for individual games, so if you want different
 settings you will need different users! Other users will see your games the same
 way you see them.</P>
<P>Here you can also choose whether you want your boards to be big </P>	
 
 </P>

	  
	  	    <h1>Features & Bugs</h1> 

<P>
	There are some features I'd like to add in the future
  <UL>
    <LI>A better user management (with email notification and password retrieval)
    <LI>kibitzing in games
	<LI>A better, more responsive interface while browsing games (not AJAX-based)
		(interactivity wasn't my main concern at the start)
	<LI>Save searches and games collections
	<LI>Multi-User games (several users commenting on a move...)</LI>
	<LI> More options (board color...)	
	<LI>Better paging (max search result > 500...)	
			
   </UL>
		
		There are some known bugs
	<UL>
	<LI>The PGN Parser is not the greatest (or as good, as, say, Chessbase Reader's ). A good idea is let
	the games go through programs which will produce fully conformant PGN games (e.g. Chessbase Reader)</LI>	
	<LI>If you have several branches starting with the same move, the chessboard
	interface will behave inpredictably</LI>	
		
	</UL>
		
		
		Feel free to mail me if you have any feature you would like me to add
</P>
