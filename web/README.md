# CHESSELLA

A personal project that I finished in 2006-2007 and then I quickly forgot about. I was disappointed that people just were not interested.

However, the software has been running stably for 10 years under http://www.chessella.com , even if I occasionally have to restart the server. 

Now, in 2017, I have decided to publish the code, but I didn't seem to have the latest version of the source - at that time I was not using source control for personal projects, stupid me.

However, decompilation is a life saver, so I reconstructed th project, and I have began working on it again.

The technology is obsolete, but it is still fun to work with.
