# CHESSELLA

A personal project that I finished in 2006-2007 and then I quickly forgot about. I was disappointed that people just were not interested.

However, the software has been running stably for 10 years under http://www.chessella.com , even if I occasionally have to restart the server. 

Now, in 2017, I have decided to publish the code, but I don't seem to have the latest version of the source - at that time I was not using source control for personal projects, stupid me.

However, decompilation is a life saver, and the full web application is available, along with the decompiled java classes under WEB-INF\src . I would be able to push another version, should there be the need to do that.

I might just content myself to actually go back to using it as I planned at the time, but regrettably I myself find Chessbase more confortable for analyzing one's games.
